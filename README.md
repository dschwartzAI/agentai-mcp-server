# Agent.AI MCP Server

This is an externally deployable version of the Agent.AI MCP Server, designed to be hosted on Vercel and called from other applications.

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free tier works)
- Git installed locally

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Agent.AI MCP Server"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentai-mcp-server.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it as a Node.js project
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Get your deployment URL**
   - After deployment, Vercel will provide a URL like: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
   - This is your MCP server endpoint

## Usage

Once deployed, you can call your MCP server from other applications using the Vercel URL.

### Example Usage
```javascript
// In your other app
const mcpServerUrl = 'https://your-project-name.vercel.app';

// Make requests to your MCP server
fetch(mcpServerUrl + '/your-endpoint')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Local Development

To run locally:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

- **Port**: Automatically set by Vercel, or defaults to 3000 locally
- **Environment Variables**: Can be set in Vercel dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your `@agentai/mcp-server` package is publicly available
- Check Vercel deployment logs if issues occur
- Verify your GitHub repository is public or Vercel has access

## Important: Disable Vercel Authentication

To allow external access to your MCP server, you MUST disable authentication in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Security"  
3. Disable "Password Protection" and "Vercel Authentication"
4. Save changes and redeploy

This ensures your app can call the MCP server without authentication barriers.
